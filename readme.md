# 1 Props :
### In React, "props" (short for properties) are a fundamental concept used for passing data from one component to another. Props are read-only and help create dynamic and interactive React applications by allowing components to communicate and share data.

## Lecture 02
### Topics Covered:
-Hooks in react

### 2 Hooks:
In Lecture 02, we learned about "hooks" in React. Hooks are tools that make it easier to work with data and how our app behaves. We explored two main hooks:

#### 2.1 useState:
useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component. 
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

#### 2.2 useEffect:
useEffect helps us do things in our components when something changes. 
For example, if we want to show a message when a button is clicked, we can use useEffect. 
It's like saying, "Hey React, do this when something happens!".
